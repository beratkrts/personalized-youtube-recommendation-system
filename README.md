# Personalized YouTube Recommendation System

## Motivation
I want to analyze my YouTube watch history to build a recommendation system tailored to my preferences. This project will help me understand recommendation systems and apply data science techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset is my personal YouTube watch history, downloaded from Google Takeout. It includes:
- Video titles
- Categories
- Watch timestamps
- Engagement metrics (likes, watched completely/partially, etc.)

## Project Idea
This project aims to build a recommendation system using:
- Content-based filtering
- Collaborative filtering

The system will predict whether I would like a new video based on metadata and my interaction history.

## Project Plan
1. **Data Collection**: Download and preprocess my YouTube history data.
2. **EDA**: Visualize patterns in my viewing habits and explore features.
3. **Model Development**:
   - Collaborative Filtering
   - Content-Based Filtering
4. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like Precision@K and Recall@K.
5. **Visualization**: Present recommendations and insights in an interactive dashboard.
6. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed analysis and code documentation.

## Expected Outcome
- A personalized recommendation system.
- Insights into my YouTube viewing patterns.

## Limitations and Future Work
- Dataset size might limit generalizability.
- Future plans include testing on larger datasets for better evaluation.
