# Personalized YouTube Recommendation System

## Motivation
I want to analyze my YouTube watch history to build a recommendation system tailored to my preferences. This project will help me understand recommendation systems and apply data science techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset is my personal YouTube watch history, downloaded from Google Takeout. It includes:
- Video titles
- Categories
- Watch timestamps
- Engagement metrics (likes, watched completely/partially, etc.)

## Project Plan
1. Data Collection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Development
4. Evaluation
5. Visualization
6. Documentation

## Expected Outcome
- A personalized recommendation system.
- Insights into my YouTube viewing patterns.

## Limitations and Future Work
Dataset size might limit generalizability. Future plans include testing on larger datasets for better evaluation.
